### Flurl is a modern, fluent, asynchronous, testable, portable, buzzword-laden URL builder and HTTP client library.

````c#
var result = await "https://api.mysite.com"
    .AppendPathSegment("person")
    .SetQueryParams(new { a = 1, b = 2 })
    .WithOAuthBearerToken("my_oauth_token")
    .PostJsonAsync(new { first_name = "Claire", last_name = "Underwood" })
    .ReceiveJson<T>();
````

With a discoverable API, [extensibility](extensibility) at every turn, and a nifty set of [testing features](testable-http), Flurl is intended to make building and calling URLs easy and downright fun.
